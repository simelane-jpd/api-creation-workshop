Create an API with a SQL database
In this section the garments will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

You will need to have PostgreSQL installed on your PC.

Database setup
Installing Postgres on Windows
Download Postgesql from this link and install it.

Specify a password of pg123 when prompted - this is for the postgres user.

Installing Postgres on Linux
To install postgres on Linux use these commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
Create the user role & database
Now in the terminal or the Windows command line run these commans

sudo -u postgres psql;
Create a database and a user to access the databae by running this command

create database missy_tee_app;
create role missy_tee login password 'missy123';
grant all privileges on database missy_tee_app to missy_tee;
Create table for the garments
Login as the missy_tee database use with psql:

psql -U missy_tee -D missy_tee_app -P
Type in the password of missy123 if prompted.

And then run this command in psql (copy and paste it) to create the garment table:

create table garment(
	id serial not null primary key,
	description text,
	img text,
	season text,
	gender text,
	price decimal(10,2)
);
To add entries to the garment table run the sql commands in the sql/insert_garments.sql file

\i sql/insert_garments.sql
Change the code to use the database
The next step is to change the code to use the database instead of the .json file.

Start by installing the postgresql driver

npm install pg
Next set a database connection up in the index.js file

Add this code to the index.js file:

const GarmentManager = require('./shop/garment-manager');
const pg = require("pg");
const Pool = pg.Pool;

const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgresql://missy_tee:missy123@localhost:5432/missy_tee_app';

const pool = new Pool({
	connectionString,
});

const garmentManager = GarmentManager(pool);
Change the /api/garments route to use the database by using the filter method on the garmetManager Factor Function.

app.get('/api/garments', async function(req, res){

	const gender = req.query.gender;
	const season = req.query.season;

	const filteredGarments = await garmentManager.filter({
		gender,
		season
	});

	res.json({ 
		garments : filteredGarments
	});
});

res.json();
If all worked well you should be able to see all the garments on the screen. And you should be able to filter data.

Also change the price filter route /api/garments/price/:price to use the filterByPrice method on the Factory Function

app.get('/api/garments/price/:price', async function(req, res){

	const maxPrice = Number(req.params.price);
	const filteredGarments = await garmentManager.filterByPrice(maxPrice);

	res.json({ 
		garments : filteredGarments
	});
});
Please make sure to study the code in the shop/garment-manager.js file. Ask if you have any questions about the code.

Note the use of async & await in the above routes. You can read more here and here if you need to refresh on async programming in JavaScript.

Adding garments to the database
The next step is to add support to store garments in the database.

Create a user table
Next we need to add a some user support to our online shop to allow each user to buy what they need.

Create a user table in PostgreSQL using this script.

create table system_user(
	id serial not null primary key,
	first_name text,
	last_name text,
	password text,
	email text,
	username text,
	user_role text
);
Supported roles are: client & admin.

Store password hashed using bcrypt.

Next we need to create these API routes to list, create & update system users

/api/users a get route to return a list of users
/api/users/:id a get route to show details for a given user
/api/users a post route to create a new user for all the given information
/api/users/:id a post route that update the details of the given user
/api/login/ - that checks the supplied username and password and return a JWT token. The token should contains username & role.
The user JSON file looks like this

{
	"first_name" : '',
	"last_name" : '',
	"password" : '',
	"email" : '',
	"username" : '',
	"user_role" : ''
}
Test the API end points
Create the above routes in index.js and create the database code in shop/user-manager.js and test them with Thunder Client.

And create some mocha tests to make sure the APIs are working. Call the API endpoints in the tests from using axios.

Create a user cart for each user
For an user to be able to shop for products the app need a Shopping cart - each user only can have one active shopping cart at any given time. A users active shopping cart should be displayed on the screen.

A shopping cart can have a status of open or completed.

If the checkout button is pressed a carts status is moving from open to completed and a user should see an empty cart afterwards

The database tables to be created are as follows:


create table shopping_cart(
	id serial not null primary key,
	user_id number,
	status text,
	foreign key (user_id) references system_user(id)
);

create table shopping_cart(
	id serial not null primary key,
	status string,
	cart_id int not null,
	garment_id int not null,
	qty int,
	foreign key (cart_id) references cart(id),
	foreign key (garment_id) references garment(id)
);

Show the shopping cart & the checkout button
To show the shopping cart on the screen remove the hidden class on the div with a cart class. Also remove the hidden - Add to cart button in the Handlebars template using to show the Garments.

Note: the data-garmentId data attribute on the Add to cart button
